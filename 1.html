A Little Prince- So I stared wide-eyed at this apparition. <strong>Don't <u>forget</u> that I was a thousand miles from any inhabited territory.</strong><br><br> Yet this little fellow seemed to be neither lost nor dying to death.
There was nothing in his appearance that suggested a child lost in the middle of the desert a thousandmiles from any inhabited territory. When I finally managed to speak, I asked him, "But...what are you doing here?"
And then he repeated, very slowly and very seriously, "Please...draw me a sheep..."

</p> In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey. Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket.
But then I remembered that I had mostly studied geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little fellow (rather crossly) that I didn't know how to draw.
